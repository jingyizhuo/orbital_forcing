## Motivation

Accurately simulating tropical pacific sea surface temperature (SST) patterns is central to understanding how the climate system responds to external forcing. Yet, even in idealized orbital forcing experiments, climate models exhibit persistent mean-state biases—such as the exaggerated equatorial Pacific cold tongue and double-ITCZ errors—that distort the coupled ocean–atmosphere feedbacks controlling SST patterns. These biases are not passive deficiencies: they actively modulate how external forcing signals, such as changes in insolation seasonality or interhemispheric energy gradients, are transmitted through the coupled system.

By investigating how mean-state biases alter the SST response under idealized orbital forcing, this study provides a physically grounded framework for interpreting inter-model differences in paleoclimate simulations. Many long-standing inconsistencies between simulated and proxy-inferred SST or precipitation patterns—such as the magnitude of Holocene monsoon enhancement or the position of the ITCZ—may stem from these structural model errors rather than from uncertainties in orbital forcing or proxy interpretation. Quantifying bias–forcing interactions thus helps isolate the true dynamical responses of the climate system from artifacts of model construction.

Beyond paleoclimate relevance, this work establishes a conceptual link between past and future climate responses. If mean-state biases can reshape the sensitivity of SST and circulation to orbital forcing, similar mechanisms may operate under anthropogenic forcing. Understanding how biases distort the forced SST pattern provides not only a way to reconcile past climate discrepancies but also a path toward constraining the uncertainty of future projections.
